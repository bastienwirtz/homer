# Custom Services

Some service can use a specific a component that provides some extra features by adding a `type` key to the service yaml
configuration and, where applicable, an apikey. Note that config.yml is exposed at /assets/config.yml via HTTP and any
apikey included in the configuration file is exposed to anyone who can access the homer instance. Only include an apikey
if your homer instance is secured behind some form of authentication or access restriction.

Available services are in `src/components/`. Here is an overview of all custom services that are available

Because the service type and link don't necessarily have to match, you could
even make the service type Tautulli on your Plex card and provide a separate
endpoint pointing to Tautulli!

```yaml
- name: "Plex"
  logo: "assets/tools/sample.png"
  url: "http://192.168.0.151:32400/web" # Plex

```

Setting `type: "Mealie"` will then show the number of recipes Mealie is keeping organized or the planned meal for today if one is planned. You will have to set an API key in the field `apikey` which can be created in your Mealie installation.

## Healthchecks

This service displays information about the configured status checks from the Healthchecks application.
Two lines are needed in the config.yml :

```yaml
  type: "Healthchecks"
  apikey: "<---insert-api-key-here--->"

## rTorrent

This service displays the global upload and download rates, as well as the number of torrents
listed in rTorrent. The service communicates with the rTorrent XML-RPC interface which needs
to be accessible from the browser. Please consult
[the instructions](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent-doc/blob/master/RPC-Setup-XMLRPC.md)
for setting up rTorrent and make sure the correct CORS-settings are applied. Examples for various
servers can be found at https://enable-cors.org/server.html.

```yaml
- name: "rTorrent"
  logo: "assets/tools/sample.png"
  url: "http://192.168.0.151" # Your rTorrent web UI, f.e. ruTorrent or Flood.
  xmlrpc: "http://192.168.0.151:8081" # Reverse proxy for rTorrent's XML-RPC.
  type: "Rtorrent"
  rateInterval: 5000 # Interval for updating the download and upload rates.
  torrentInterval: 60000 # Interval for updating the torrent count.
  username: "username" # Username for logging into rTorrent (if applicable).
  password: "password" # Password for logging into rTorrent (if applicable).
```


## Proxmox

This service displays status information of a Proxmox node (VMs running and disk, memory and cpu used). It uses the proxmox API and [API Tokens](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/pveum-plain.html) for authorization so you need to generate one to set in the yaml config. You can set it up in Proxmox under Permissions > API Tokens. You also need to know the realm the user of the API Token is assigned to (by default pam).

The API Token (or the user asigned to that token if not separated permissions is checked) are this:

| Path               | Permission | Comments                                                          |
|--------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /nodes/<your-node> | Sys.Audit  |                                                                   |
| /vms/<id-vm>       | VM.Audit   | You need to have this permission on any VM you want to be counted |

It is highly recommended that you create and API Token with only these permissions on a read-only mode.

If you get errors, they will be shown on browser's dev console. Main issues tend to be CORS related as Proxmox does not include CORS headers and you have to deploy it behind a reverse proxy and make the proxy add this headers.

Configuration example:

```yaml
- name: "Proxmox - Node"
  logo: "https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FandOTP%2FandOTP%2Fissues%2F337&psig=AOvVaw2YKVuEUIBeTUikr7kAjm8D&ust=1665323538747000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAkQjRxqFwoTCPCTruLj0PoCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAN"
  type: "Proxmox"
  url: "https://your.proxmox.server"
  node: "your-node-name"
  warning_value: 50
  danger_value: 80
  api_token: "PVEAPIToken=root@pam!your-api-token-name=your-api-token-key"
  # values below this line are optional (default value are false/empty):
  hide_decimals: true # removes decimals from stats values.
  hide: [] # hides information. Possible values are "vms", "vms_total", "lxcs", "lxcs_total", "disk", "mem" and "cpu".
  small_font_on_small_screens: true # uses small font on small screens (like mobile)
  small_font_on_desktop: true # uses small font on desktops (just in case you're showing much info)
```

## qBittorrent

This service displays the global upload and download rates, as well as the number of torrents
listed. The service communicates with the qBittorrent API interface which needs
to be accessible from the browser. Please consult
[the instructions](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/pull/12579)
for setting up qBittorrent and make sure the correct CORS-settings are applied. Examples for various
servers can be found at [enable-cors.org](https://enable-cors.org/server.html).

```yaml
- name: "qBittorrent"
  logo: "assets/tools/sample.png"
  url: "http://192.168.1.2:8080" # Your rTorrent web UI, f.e. ruTorrent or Flood.
  type: "qBittorrent"
  rateInterval: 2000 # Interval for updating the download and upload rates.
  torrentInterval: 5000 # Interval for updating the torrent count.
  target: "_blank" # optional html a tag target attribute

You can still provide an `url` that would be open when clicked anywhere but on the icon button.

Configuration example:

```yaml
- name: "Copy me!"

Moonraker's API mimmicks a few of OctoPrint's endpoints which makes these services compatible. See https://moonraker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web_api/#octoprint-api-emulation for details.

```yaml
- name: "Octoprint"
  logo: "https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/3112/3112529.png"
  apikey: "xxxxxxxxxxxx" # insert your own API key here.
