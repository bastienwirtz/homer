# Smart cards

Smart cards provide specific integrations for external services. They display additional information and extra features beyond basic service card. Smart cards are enabled by adding a `type` key to the service item in your YAML configuration.

Each service integration has different requirements and may need additional configuration parameters (see card list below).

> [!WARNING]  
> Your `config.yml` file is exposed at `/assets/config.yml` via HTTP. Any sensitive information (like API keys)
> in this file is visible to anyone who can access your Homer instance. Only include API keys if your Homer
> instance is protected by authentication or access controls **or use a proxy like [`CORSair`](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/corsair)
>  to inject your credentials safely**, using environment variable on the server side.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Smart cards that interact with external services are subject to CORS restrictions, therefore require one of the following:
>
> - All services hosted on the **same domain** as Homer (mydomain.tld/pihole, mydomain.tld/proxmox) to avoid cross-domain request entirely.
> - All services configured to **accept cross-site requests** by sending the necessary CORS headers (either directly in service configuration or via proxy).
> - **Use a proxy** to add the necessary CORS headers (lot of options, some of them described [here](https://enable-cors.org/server.html). Also check [`CORSair`](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/corsair), a light and simple solution)
>
> If you experience any issues, see the [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#my-service-card-doesnt-work-nothing-appears-or-offline-status-is-displayed-pi-hole-sonarr-ping-) page.

## Common options

## Linkding

This integration makes it possible to query Linkding and list multiple results from Linkding.
Linkding has to be configured with CORS enabled. Linkding does not support that, but a reverse proxy in front can fix that.
This integration supports at max 15 results from Linkding, but you can add it multiple times to you dashboard with different queries to retrieve what you need.

The API Token (or the user assigned to that token if not separated permissions is checked) are this:

| Path                | Permission | Comments                                                          |

for setting up rTorrent.

```yaml
- name: "rTorrent"
  type: "Rtorrent"
  logo: "assets/tools/sample.png"
  url: "https://my-service.url" # Your rTorrent web UI, f.e. ruTorrent or Flood.

  apikey: "<---insert-api-key-here--->"
```

**API Key**: An API key is required, and can be obtained from the "Web Interface" section of settings on the Tautulli web UI.

Because the service type and link don't necessarily have to match, you could
even make the service type Tautulli on your Plex card and provide a separate
endpoint pointing to Tautulli!

```yaml
- name: "Plex"
  type: "Tautulli"
